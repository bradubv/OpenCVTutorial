When processing image we get about 10 FPS.  First time to make sure the problem is on the Pi
, then enable target tracking on demand if it is.

Remove debug notes from the Vision pipeline (or put them there on demand)

The video was lost forever when turning too fast.  Test that.

Get NavX turn based program () into the command based HelloRobot

Determine turn size based on error

Draw target on the Dashboard

Make sure we're all the way in.

Calculate distance based on the number of pixels

DONE: Wiggle on HelloRobot
DONE: Switch Camera on HelloRobot
DONE: Find out why the Quad code is bombing on some of the EveningHome pictures
DONE: Put the pi code in Git (refresh the pi code on r2d2)
DONE: Show horizontal distance from lower left corner of left target to center. Call it error
DONE: Break up the Pipeline into Basic (base) and DebugPipeline (inherited from base)
DONE: Move BasicPipeline to the Raspberry Pi
DONE: Only process image in autonomous and if someone told us to in teleop.
